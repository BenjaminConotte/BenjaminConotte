## Hello world ðŸ‘‹
I'm a French software engineer based at Bordeaux, France. I enjoy test new technologies into project to be able to understand how the "tech world" evolves years after years.  
I have mainly "DevOps" and Backend skills and the Basic front-end skills.
You can see my portfolio [there](https://www.benjaminconotte.me/).
